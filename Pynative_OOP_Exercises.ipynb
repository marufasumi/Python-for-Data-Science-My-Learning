    "Introduction to the Python __init__() method\n",
    "When you create a new object of a class, Python automatically calls the __init__() method to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular methods, the __init__() method has two underscores (__) on each side. Therefore, the __init__() is often called dunder init. The name comes abbreviation of the double underscores init.\n",
    "\n",
    "The double underscores at both sides of the __init__() method indicate that Python will use the method internally. In other words, you should not explicitly call this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python will automatically call the __init__() method immediately after creating a new object, you can use the __init__() method to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following defines the Person class with the __init__() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    person = Person('John', 25)\n",
    "    print(f\"I'm {person.name}. I'm {person.age} years old.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "When you create an instance of the Person class, Python performs two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a new instance of the Person class by setting the object’s namespace such as __dict__ attribute to empty ({}).\n",
    "Second, call the __init__ method to initialize the attributes of the newly created object.\n",
    "Note that the __init__ method doesn’t create the object but only initializes the object’s attributes. Hence, the __init__() is not a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the __init__ has parameters other than the self, you need to pass the corresponding arguments when creating a new object like the example above. Otherwise, you’ll get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method with default parameters\n",
    "The __init__() method’s parameters can have default values. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age=22):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "I'm John. I'm 22 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the age parameter has a default value of 22. Because we don’t pass an argument to the Person(), the age uses the default value.\n"

    "Polymorphism in Python is the ability of an object to take many forms. In simple words, polymorphism allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.\n",

    "Advantage of method overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "It is effective when we want to extend the functionality by altering the inherited method. Or the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t fulfill the need of a child class, so we need to re-implement the same method in the child class in a different way.\n",
    "Method overriding is useful when a parent class has multiple child classes, and one of that child class wants to redefine the method. The other child classes can use the parent class method. Due to this, we don’t need to modification the parent class code\n",
    "In polymorphism, Python first checks the object’s class type and executes the appropriate method when we call the method. For example, If you create the Car object, then Python calls the speed() method from a Car class.\n",
